This is a simple Multiplayer game written in Node JS

The game is inspired by Jackbox Patently stupid

I wanted to play it with my class but they have a limit on players.
So I decided to make it up to 20 players.

Im working to release the first version

Sorry for bad language! Im not a English guy!
